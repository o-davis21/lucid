	<h1>A Bit About Me</h1>
	<p>Hello! My name is Owen.
		I am a wholehearted Slytherin, Eagle Scout, and an aspiring computer software engineer.
		My largest strengths are being a strategist, philomath, storyteller, catalyst, and wanting to be at the top of the top.
		Some of my hobbies included building and programming robots, learning new things, Boy Scouts, traveling, being involved in my church, and serving the community!
		I have attended three high schools before I graduated.
		I hope this helps you to get to know me better!</p>
