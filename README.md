1/29/2024 - Project Lucid - FINISHED

This project was a full semester for SWEN.101 (Software Engineering Freshman Seminar).

The group was tasked with addressing an issue and creating a solution and displaying it via website. Our group chose to address the issue of addictions within young adults from 18-35.
We created Lucid Community which would be a platform where those who have addictions could find a community of people who share the same addiction. Lucid Community would also 
offer an online therapy outlet and resources for both the person and their family and friends.

This project took an estimate of 50 hours which was broken into drafting, UI mockups, wireframes, prototypes, and the final product.

This project is being hosted on Github Pages.
